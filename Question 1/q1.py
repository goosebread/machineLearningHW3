#sample generator
#distributions and generate samples files

#make theoretically optimal MAP classifier


#Neural Network Model

#try 5 to 14 perceptrons? (if we see a trend, we can come back to fix)

#do training and cross validation (training vs validation samples)

#check all classifiers against test samples

#plot p(error) vs training dataset size for true param model & NN models
